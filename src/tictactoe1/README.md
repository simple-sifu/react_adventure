# Tic Tac Toe version 1

## Lifting State Up

To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass the state back down to the children by using props; this keeps the child components in sync with each other and with the parent component

## Wrapping upCongratulations! You’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:

1. Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
2. Indicates when a player has won the game,
3. Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
4. Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
