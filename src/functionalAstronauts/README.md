# Function component

In React, function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and donâ€™t have their own state. Instead of defining a class which extends React.Component, we can write a function that takes props as input and returns what should be rendered. Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many components can be expressed this way.
